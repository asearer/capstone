First idea-
A football app that aggregates data and predicts scores.

I feel this is too common, even though it fits directly with my interests. Even though football is the most popular sport, I feel that this might add to oversaturation in terms of how many apps there are to do this.


Second idea-
An app using NASA apis

Though it fits with my interests and would be a fun and interesting project it doesn't seem that I could implement it the way I might like given time constraints. There are so many APIs and options...there are so many ways that I could implement it that I would not have the time to do it. Not to mention the fact that even though I am interested in astronomy, it is not a wide spread field that everyone is interested in.


Third idea-
chat app

I lean more towards this due to the options available. It allows me to emphasize my interests as well as utilize what I've learned in a manner that may allow me to break into the field I would prefer to be involved in.

The more thought I put into this idea, the more I would like to do the chat app because I think that there is much more interest and use for an app like this.
